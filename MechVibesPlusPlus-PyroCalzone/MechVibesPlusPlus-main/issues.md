## Software issues

- Blank soundpack list
    - Mechvibes++ automatically attempts to **not** load any soundpacks that appear broken. This may not work sometimes. Delete any recently installed soundpacks
- Does not stop loading
    - Install VC Redist, listed on the [main information doc](README.md)
- No mouse sounds visual
    - Enable it in your system tray.
- No audio and/or UI is not updating after fresh install
    - Quit (system tray) and re-open the app

## System issues

- No audio
    - Check system sound settings & drivers, and make sure there is no conflicting software
    - Run MechVibes++ as administrator
- Windows flagged it as a virus
    - Windows Defender will probably block the Mechvibes++ installer. In simple terms, this is because we have not made Microsoft verify that the software as safe (hence "unknown publisher")
    - The program is not a virus. Feel free to scroll through the public online code, and/or scan it with your antivirus software of choice. 
    - To stop it from being blocked, click on “more info” and then “Run anyway” 
- High RAM Usage
    - If regular Mechvibes is open: Quit it from system tray
    - Delete large and unused soundpacks
    - Otherwise: Solution is being made
- Poor game performance (or input lag)
    - This is not an issue on our end- your (likely low-end) computer cannot perform correctly with both the game and Mechvibes++
